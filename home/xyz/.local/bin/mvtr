# can use ls pipe to sed pipe to bash, similar to eval? see comment at link:
# link also show perl-rename approach

# if only change ' ' to '_' `rename` might be sufficient, for upper to lower case might need perl-rename if want concise

# ./_filename will be renamed ./filename, not what I want, need improve
# -exec can't replace -execdir here, can write a -exec version
